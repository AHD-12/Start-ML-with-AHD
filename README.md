# Start-ML-with-AHD
This is starter of road ML 
I Normalization magic dataset and ran some supervised learning Algorithm

and Neural Net
Beater Run it in colab. 

I learn this from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg&t=7812s this video it good for me i hope see it and use my code :)

I hope to achieve the goal I want--to become a professional programmers, and perhaps even make a new contribution to computer community and also hope the world lives in peace, and perhaps I can help bring about the peace. 
I also hope that you, who read the faith, reach your goals, no matter how big they are.
