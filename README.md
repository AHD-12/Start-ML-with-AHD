# Start-ML-with-AHD
This is starter of road ML 
I Normalization magic dataset and ran some supervised learning Algorithm
like ===> KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM
and Neural Net

- Beater Run it in colab. 
- Upload magic data to colab.
- Then open magic finished
- In Neural net you can uncomment line I maked and comment another line and use loop for find better prameter .
====>   #for num_nodes in [16, 32, 64]:
        for num_nodes in [164]:
====>       #for dropout_prob in [0, 0.2]:
            for dropout_prob in [0.2]:
====>           #for lr in [0.01, 0.005, 0.001]:
                for lr in [0.001]:
====>              #for batch_size in [32, 64, 128]:
                    for batch_size in [128]:

I learn this from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg&t=7812s this video it good for me i hope see it and use my code :)

I hope to achieve the goal I want--to become a professional programmers, and perhaps even make a new contribution to computer community and also hope the world lives in peace, and perhaps I can help bring about the peace. 
I also hope that you, who read the faith, reach your goals, no matter how big they are.
